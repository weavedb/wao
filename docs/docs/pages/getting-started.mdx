# Get started

WAO SDK streamlines Arweave/AO development with elegant syntax enhancements and seamless message piping for enjoyable coding experiences. GraphQL operations are also made super easy.

Additionally, it includes a drop-in replacement for `aoconnect`, allowing the testing of lua scripts 1000x faster than the mainnet by emulating AO units in memory. It's even 100x faster than testing with [arlocal](https://github.com/textury/arlocal) and [ao-localnet](https://github.com/permaweb/ao-localnet).

WAO is not only for in-memory testing, but also for lightweight standanoe AO units and web embeddable AO units. You can type a simple command `npx wao`, and you will have your own AO units on your local computer.

You can open up a browser at [preview.wao.eco](https://preview.wao.eco) and you will have all the AO units (MU/SU/CU/Gateway) right in your browser with an AOS terminal, a coding editor, and a local AO explorer to make debugging easier.

WAO is also compatible with [HyperBEAM](https://permaweb.github.io/HyperBEAM/) and Mainnet AOS processes. You can launch a HyperBEAM node from withing JS test code and create a sandbox environment for the test.
