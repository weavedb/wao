# Get started

WAO SDK streamlines Arweave/AO development with elegant syntax enhancements and seamless message piping for enjoyable coding experiences. GraphQL operations are also made super easy.

Additionally, it includes a drop-in replacement for `aoconnect`, allowing the testing of lua scripts 1000x faster than the mainnet by emulating AO units in memory. It's even 100x faster than testing with [arlocal](https://github.com/textury/arlocal) and [ao-localnet](https://github.com/permaweb/ao-localnet).
