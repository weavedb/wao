# AR

`AR` handles operations on the base Arweave Storage layer as well as wallet connections.

## Instantiate

```js
import { AR } from "wao"
const ar = new AR()
```
`host`, `port`, and `protocol` can be set to access a specific gateway rather than `https://arweave.net`.

```js
const ar = new AR({ host: "localhost", port: 4000, protocol: "http" })
```

In the case of local gateways, you can only set `port` and the rest will be automatically figured out.
```js
const ar = new AR({ port: 4000 })
```

`AO` class auto-instantiates `AR` internally.

```js
import { AO } from "wao"
const ao = new AO()
const ar = ao.ar
```

## Set or Generate Wallet

You can initialize AR with a wallet JWK or ArConnect.

```js
const ar = await new AR().init(jwk || arweaveWallet)
```

Or you can generate a new wallet. In case of ArLocal, you can mint AR at the same time.

```js
const { jwk, addr, pub, balance } = await ar.gen("100") // mint 100 AR
```

Once a wallet is set in one of these 3 ways, you cannot use the instance with another wallet unless you re-initialize it with another wallet. This is to prevent executing transactions with the wrong wallet when the browser connected active address has been changed unknowingly.

You can go on without calling `init` or `gen`, in this case, AR generates a random wallet when needed, and also using different wallets will be allowed. This is useful, if you are only calling `dryrun` with AO, since AO requires a signature for `dryrun` too, but you don't want to bother the user by triggering the browser extension wallet for read only calls.

Once a wallet is set, `ar.jwk` and `ar.addr` will be available.

## Token Related Methods

### toAddr

Convert a jwk to the corresponding address.

```js
const addr = await ar.toAddr(jwk)
```

### mine

Mine pending blocks (only for arlocal).

```js
await ar.mine()
```

### balance | toAR | toWinston

Get the current balance of the specified address in AR. `addr` will be `ar.addr` if omitted.

```js
const balance_AR = await ar.balance() // get own balance
const balance_Winston = ar.toWinston(balance_AR)
const balance_AR2 = ar.toAR(balance_Winston)
const balance_AR3 = await ar.balance(addr) // specify wallet address
```

### transfer

Transfer AR token. `amount` is in AR, not in winston for simplicity.

```js
const { id } = await ar.transfer(amount, to)
```

You can set a jwk to the 3rd parameter as a sender. Otherwise, the sender is `ar.jwk`.

```js
const { id } = await ar.transfer(amount, to, jwk)
```

For most write functions, `jwk` can be specified as the last parameter or a field like `{ data, tags, jwk }`.


### checkWallet

`checkWallet` is mostly used internally, but it returns `this.jwk` if a wallet has been assigned with `init`, or else it generates a random wallet to use. The following pattern is used in many places. With this pattern, if a wallet is set with `init` and the `jwk` the user is passing is different, `checkWallet` produces an error to prevent the wrong wallet. If no wallet has been set with `init` or `gen` and the `jwk` is not passed, it generates and returns a random wallet.

```js
some_class_method({ jwk }){
  let err = null
  ;({ err, jwk } = await ar.checkWallet({ jwk }))
  if(!err){
    // do something with the jwk
  }
}
```

## Storage Related Methods

### post 

Post a data to Arweave.

```js
const { err, id } = await ar.post({ data, tags })
```

`tags` are not an Array but a hash map Object for brevity.

```js
const tags = { "Content-Type": "text/markdown", Type: "blog-post" }
```

If you must use the same name for multiple tags, the value can be an Array.

```js
const tags = { Name: [ "name-tag-1", "name-tag-2" ] }
```

### tx

Get a transaction.

```js
const tx = await ar.tx(txid)
```

### data

Get a data.

```js
const data = await ar.data(txid, true) // true if string
```

### bundle

Bundle ANS-104 dataitems.

```js
const { err, id } = await ar.bundle(dataitems)
```
`dataitems` are `[ [ data, tags ], [ data, tags ], [ data, tags ] ]`.
```js
const { err, id } = await ar.bundle([
  [ "this is text", { "Content-Type": "text/plain" }],
  [ "# this is markdown", { "Content-Type": "text/markdown" }],
  [ png_image, { "Content-Type": "image/png" }]
])
```
