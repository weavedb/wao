# ArMem

`ArMem` stands for Arweave in memory and is a class to emulate an Arweave node and AO units in memory, which is internally used in the WAO testing framework. You can instantiate `ArMem` and control multiple emulators by passing it between other classes.

## Instantiate

When you instantiate WAO `connect` or `AO` from `wao/test`, it automatically and internally instantiates `ArMem`.

```js
import { connect } from "wao/test"
const { spawn, message, dryrun, assign, result, mem } = connect() // aoconnect APIs
```


```js
import { AO } from "wao/test"
const ao = new AO() // ao.mem
```

## Shared Memory

You can instantiate `ArMem` and pass it to other classes.

```js
import { ArMem, AO, AR, connect } from "wao/test"
const mem = new ArMem()
const { spawn, message, dryrun, assign, result } = connect(mem)
const ao = new AO({ mem })
const ar = new AR({ mem })
```

If you don't pass the same `ArMem` instance, the two AO instances will have different environments.

```js
import { AO } from "wao/test"
const ao = new AO() // ao.mem
const ao2 = new AO() // ao2.mem
```

`ao.mem` and `ao2.mem` are not connected. They are on different networks.

```js
import { AO } from "wao/test"
const ao = new AO()
const ao2 = new AO({ mem: ao.mem })
```

This will connect the two.
