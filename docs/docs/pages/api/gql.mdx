# GQL

`GQL` simplifies [the Arwave GraphQL](https://gql-guide.vercel.app/) operations to query blocks and transactions.

## Instantiate

You can instantiate the GQL class with an endpoint `url`.

```js
import { GQL } from "wao"
const gql = new GQL({ url: "https://arweave.net/graphql" }) // the default url
```

`AR` class auto-instantiates `GQL` internally.

```js
import { AO } from "wao"
const ao = new AO()
const gql = ao.ar.gql
```
```js
import { AR } from "wao"
const ar = new AR()
const gql = ar.gql
```

## Txs

Get latest transactions.

```js
const txs = await gql.txs()
```

### asc

Get transactions in ascending order.

```js
const txs = await gql.txs({ asc: true })
```

### first

Get the firxt X transactions.

```js
const txs = await gql.txs({ first: 3 })
```

### after

Get transactions after a specific one to paginate. Pass a `cursor`.

```js
const txs = await gql.txs({ first: 3 })
const txs2 = await gql.txs({ first: 3, after: txs[2].cursor })
```

### next

Easier pagination with `next`.

```js
const { next, data: txs0_2 } = await gql.txs({ first: 3, next: true })
const { next: next2, data: txs3_5 } = await next()
const { next: next3, data: txs6_8 } = await next2()
```

`res.next` will be `null` if there's no more transactions to paginate.

### block

Get transactions within a block height range.

```js
const txs = await gql.txs({ block: { min: 0, max: 10 } })
```

or


```js
const txs = await gql.txs({ block: [0, 10] })
```

You can also specify only `min` or `max`.

### by Transaction IDs

Get transactions by transaction ids.

```js
const txs = await gql.txs({ id: TXID })
```
or

```js
const txs = await gql.txs({ ids: [ TXID1, TXID2, TXID3 ] })
```

### by Recipients

Get transactions by recipients.

```js
const txs = await gql.txs({ recipient: ADDR })
```
or

```js
const txs = await gql.txs({ recipients: [ ADDR1, ADDR2, ADDR3 ] })
```

### by Owners

Get transactions by owners.

```js
const txs = await gql.txs({ owner: ADDR })
```
or

```js
const txs = await gql.txs({ owners: [ ADDR1, ADDR2, ADDR3 ] })
```

### by Tags

Get transactions that match tags.

```js
const txs = await gql.txs({ tags: { Name: "Bob", Age: "30" } })
```

### fields

Choose fields to be returned.

```js
const txs = await gql.txs({ fields: ["id", "recipient"] })
```

For nested objects,

```js
const txs = await gql.txs({ fields: ["id", { owner: ["address", "key"] }] })
```

You can use a hashmap to specify fields too.

```js
const txs = await gql.txs({ 
  fields: { id: true, { owner: { address: true, key: true } } } 
})
```

If you assign `false`, the other fields will be returned.

```js
const txs = await gql.txs({ 
  fields: { id: true, { block: { previous: false } } } 
})
```

For example, the above will exclude `previous` from `block` and return `id`, `timestamp` and `height`.

The entire available fields for transactions as in a graphql query are as follows.

```js
const tx_fields = `{
  id 
  anchor 
  signature 
  recipient 
  owner { address key } 
  fee { winston ar } 
  quantity { winston ar } 
  data { size type } 
  tags { name value } 
  block { id timestamp height previous } 
  parent { id }
  bundledIn { id }
}`
```

## Blocks

Get latest blocks.

```js
const blocks = await gql.blocks()
```

### asc

Get blocks in ascending order.

```js
const blocks = await gql.blocks({ asc: true })
```

### first

Get the firxt X blocks.

```js
const blocks = await gql.blocks({ first: 3 })
```

### after

Get blocks after a specific one to paginate. Pass a `cursor`.

```js
const blocks = await gql.blocks({ first: 3 })
const blocks2 = await gql.blocks({ first: 3, after: blocks[2].cursor })
```

### by Block IDs

Get blocks by block ids.

```js
const blocks = await gql.blocks({ id: BLCID })
```
or

```js
const blocks = await gql.blocks({ ids: [ BLKID1, BLKID2, BLKID3 ] })
```

### height

Get blocks within a block height range.

```js
const blocks = await gql.blocks({ height: { min: 0, max: 10 } })
```

or


```js
const blocks = await gql.blocks({ height: [0, 10] })
```

### next

Easier pagination with `next`.

```js
const { next, data: blocks0_2 } = await gql.blocks({ first: 3, next: true })
const { next: next2, data: blocks3_5 } = await next() 
const { next: next3, data: blocks6_8 } = await next2()
```

`res.next` will be `null` if there's no more blocks to paginate.

### fields

```js
const blocks = await gql.blocks({ 
  fields: ["id", "timestamp", "height", "previous"]
})
```

The entire available fields for blocks as in a graphql query are as follows.

```js
const block_fields = `{ id timestamp height previous }`
```
