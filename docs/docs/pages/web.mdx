# AO The Web

AO The Web brings AO units directly into the browserâ€”completely standalone, with no external dependencies. It includes an integrated AOS terminal, a code editor, and a local AO explorer for seamless development and debugging.

WAO is both a standalone AO unit emulator and a lightweight SDK, enabling you to embed fully functional AO units into any web application with just a single line of code.

```js
import { AO } from "wao/web"
```
